Go back in Google Doodles history and get doodles for any date
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doodle), Google Doodles history starts on 1998/8/30 when Larry Page and Sergey Brin designed the first Google Doodle to let Google users at the time that Larry and Sergey were at the Burning Man Festival, just in case the servers crashed :).

Ever since, Google has been designing Google Doodles to celebrate different people and events through out history. I've always been intrigued by Google Doodles. Apparently there is a whole team at Google that makes these things. The coolest thing about them is the [Doogle 4 Google Challenge](https://doodles.google.com/d4g/) which allows any one to submit a Google doodle for a prize and their art can be used worldwide!

Anyway, I am no artist, so here is my Google Doodle contribution!

Otherwise you will get a `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.` error.
