## [Today in Google Doodles history](https://jonly03.github.io/today-in-google-doodles-history/)
Go back in Google Doodles history and get doodles for any date.
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doodle), Google Doodles history starts on 1998/8/30 when Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, designed the first Google Doodle to let Google users at the time that Larry and Sergey were at the Burning Man Festival, just in case the servers crashed :).

Ever since, Google has been designing Google Doodles to celebrate different people and events through out history. I've always been intrigued by how cool Google Doodles are. Apparently there is a whole team of artists, designers, and developers at Google that makes these things every day! The coolest thing about Google Doodles is the [Doogle 4 Google Challenge](https://doodles.google.com/d4g/) which allows any one to submit a Google doodle for a prize and their art can be used worldwide on the Google's website!

Anyway, I am no artist nor designer, so [here is my Google Doodle contribution!](https://jonly03.github.io/today-in-google-doodles-history/)
